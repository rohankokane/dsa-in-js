### STEP 1. UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM

    1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    Implement addition
    2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
        -ints ?
        -floats?
        -what about strings for large numbers?
    3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
        - int? float? string?
    4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? or do we have enough information to solve the problem?
        - in this example we need 2 inputs but only given 1 what to do in such case?
    5. How should I label important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

### STEP 2. CONCRETE EXAMPLES

    1. start with simple examples -  with input and output
    2. Progress to more complex examples
    3. Explore examples with empty inputs
    4. explore with invalid inputs

### STEP 3. BREAK IT DOWN (before writing code)

    1. Explicitly start writing down steps; comments desc
    2. It can help you to understand better and tell interviewer that you know the right approach

### STEP 4. Solve / Simplify

    1. Ignore the part which is giving you tough time
    2. Get done with other part
    3. Then do the difficult part

### STEP 5. REFACTOR

    1. check result
    2. different approaches to same problem?
    3. Can you understand your solution at a glance
    4. can you use this method for some other problem
    5. Can you improve the performance bigO
    6. other ways to refactor?
    7. How other people solved this problem? ask to interviewer..
